## MVVM Why not ?

## MVVM Best practice

- Separation of concerns
> These UI-based classes should only contain logic that handles UI and operating system interactions. By keeping these classes as lean as possible, you can avoid many lifecycle-related problems.


- Notice that each component depends only on the component one level below it. 
> For example, activities and fragments depend only on a view model. The repository is the only class that depends on multiple other classes; in this example, the repository depends on a persistent data model and a remote backend data source.

## Dagger Hilt

>Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. 

- Hilt vs Dagger
 - Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides. For more information, see Hilt and Dagger.
